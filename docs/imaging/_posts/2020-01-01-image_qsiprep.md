To achieve consistent quality ratings across all studies in RBC, every diffusion image was manually evaluated by 2-5 expert raters using Swipes for Science ([Keshavan et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31139070/)). These ratings allowed us to assign each image a score of "Pass", "Artifact", or "Fail". In addition to these manual ratings, we provide automated quality metrics that quantify the quality of diffusion data. These automated measures have shown to be accurate indicators of data quality and capture variation within the coarse categories provided by manual ratings.
