               AI2D: Center for AI and Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics
          </b>
     </p>
     <p>
          The AI2D Center was formed in 2022, bringing together a community of faculty, trainees and staff working in the broader field of AI and Biomedical Data Science, as it applies to the field of Integrated Diagnostics, i.e. the synthesis of diverse and complementary types of biomarkers contributing to precision diagnostic.

          </b>
     </p>
     <p>
          Many labs are often interested in the same large, publicly available neuroimaging datasets, which can be processed using the same standardized pipelines. However, data curation and processing are frequently performed independently across labs, resulting in duplicated effort, wasted computational resources, and inefficient use of storage.
     </p>
     <p>
          AI2D Neuroimaging Data addresses these challenges by centrally curating imaging data and processing it through standardized pipelines. By providing a shared, centralized resource, AI2D streamlines efforts across participating labs, eliminating redundancy, improving consistency, and accelerating scientific discovery.

               Reproducible and open science
          </b>
     </p>
     <p>
          Every element of AI2D Neuroimaging Data is open and reproducible â€“ including image curation, image processing, and all analyses.
          Each step is tracked using DataLad, which provides version control for data just like Git provides version control for code.
          AI2D Neuroimaging Data thus combines open data and open code to maximize reproducibility and enhance confidence.
